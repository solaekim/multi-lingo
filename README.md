# Multilingual Learning Web Application
## Project Overview
This project, inspired by my personal language learning experience, aims to create a web app that enables users to efficiently compare and study up to three languages simultaneously.

Unlike traditional multilingual translators, it provides accurate full-sentence translations along with real-time vocabulary, idiomatic expressions, and example sentence suggestions, supporting a more intuitive learning process.

By integrating AI-driven features, this tool addresses inefficiencies in conventional methods and offers a multilingual learning environment for better results with less effort.
